APOPO is an NGO that trains rats and dogs to detect landmines and tuberculosis. We chose APOPO to carry out a summer campaign because we believe the potential audience will be easily attracted by APOPO\'s work with their cute animals helping human to make this world better. During the designing process of the campaign, the war in Ukraine has happened, so we decided to not only include the landmine area in general, but also target on people in Ukraine who needs help.', 'With some research, we found that in past campaigns, APOPO has put more effort into offline activities, and during the pandemic time, it is not a good idea to gather guests for a training center trip. Also, in past campaign such as \"2020 Year of Rat\", APOPO has created a rat character as visual interest, but it is less attractive.', 'Firstly, we decided to build a 3D model of HeroRat that stands for APOPO. We wanted to carry out a campaign that most people, if not everyone, can participate in, regardless of their equipment or location. Therefore, we planned a location-based camera function for users to let the HeroRat detect fictional landmines by taking photos. In the second stage, we thought the purpose of the camera function is less clear, so we adjusted the activity to a 5 km running event that collects funds for APOPO and Ukraine warzones. The user can use our campaign app to track their running time and distance. If the user does not like running, they can also donate directly through the app.', 'Design process of character model.', 'apopo'),

This task can be broken down into several steps: 1) letting the audience understand the context of the posters; 2) visualizing the fluid, everchanging hallucination on still images; 3) applying the environment to suggest the outcome of the story.', 'By researching related topics, I found that after using marijuana, people reported that they are more aware of sensations and see vivid colors.
